# Register a user

Work inside the `register` function in `src/App.jsx`.

1. Send a request to your [auth-hashing](https://github.com/boolean-uk/auth-hashing) API's register route with the user's credentials in the body.
2. Save the response in state using the `setRegisterResponse` function.
3. You will see the response message displayed under the register form if you were successful.
